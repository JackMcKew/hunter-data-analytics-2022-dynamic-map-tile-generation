## What are map tiles?

<div class="r-stack">
<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" src="img/no-data.png" alt="no-data"/>

<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" src="img/zones.png" alt="zones"/>

<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" src="img/points.png" alt="points"/>

</div>

Note: Deckee ingests data from over 100+ sources to produce these specific tiles

---

## Why use map tiles?

Map tiles enable splitting up the world into smaller chunks.

### So many tiles

<div class="r-stack">
<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" src="img/zoom1.png" alt="zoom1"/>

<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" src="img/zoom2.png" alt="zoom2"/>

<img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" src="img/zoom3.png" alt="zoom3"/>

</div>

### Projection hell

Robinson vs Mercator

Note: Mercator is used from sailing for constant true direction means that the straight line connecting any two points on the map is the same direction that a compass would show.

## Types of map tiles

* Raster

* Vector

## Why can't data stay the same ðŸ˜¡

Maps change every second of every day in some way, especially on the water

USCG publishes changes every day to their ~55,000 points spread across the Americas

---
## Tile servers

* Tegola
* T rex
* Raw files (tippecanoe)
* Map tiler
* Mapbox Tiling Service (MTS)

> Deckee uses Tegola
